    <releaseNotes>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is new in this release:

v3.0.0 :
    1.	General Availability of REST-backed cmdlets for Exchange Online which do not require WinRM Basic Authentication to be enabled.
    2.	General Availability of Certificate Based Authentication for Security and Compliance PowerShell cmdlets.
    3.	Support for System-Assigned and User-Assigned ManagedIdentities to connect to ExchangeOnline from Azure VMs, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Azure Functions.
    4.	Breaking changes
        -	Get-PSSession cannot be used to get information about the sessions created as PowerShell Remoting is no longer being used. The Get-ConnectionInformation cmdlet has been introduced instead, to get information about the existing connections to ExchangeOnline. Refer https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/get-connectioninformation?view=exchange-ps for more information.
        -	Certain cmdlets that used to prompt for confirmation in specific scenarios will no longer have this prompt and the cmdlet will run to completion by default.
        -	The format of the error returned from a failed cmdlet execution has been slightly modified. The Exception contains some additional data such as the exception type, and the FullyQualifiedErrorId does not contain the FailureCategory. The format of the error is subject to further modifications.
        -   Deprecation of the Get-OwnerlessGroupPolicy and Set-OwnerlessGroupPolicy cmdlets.

v2.0.3 :

    3. Connect with Exchange Online and Security Compliance Center simultaneously in a single PowerShell window.
